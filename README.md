# NLP Sentiment Analysis

## An Amazon reviews sentiment analysis using NLTK

In this project, I have used pre-trained `RoBERTa` model, and also, through `nltk` library, `VADER` models to do a sentiment analysis for Amazon reviews. 
I have also used `transformers` with `softmax`, and used data visualization techniques for a more clear view into data & results.
